*NOTE* This code is *EXPERIMENTAL*, use it at your own risk!

This is a free (BSD-licensed) TrueCrypt implementation. It is based solely on
the documentation available on the TrueCrypt website, many hours of
trial and error and the output of the Linux' TrueCrypt client. As it turns out,
every single technical document on TrueCrypt contains mistakes, hence the
trial and error approach :)

Some notable differences between actual implementation and documentation:
 - PBKDF using RIPEMD160 only uses 2000 iterations if the volume isn't a system
   volume.
 - The keyfile pool is not XOR'ed with the passphrase but modulo-8 summed.
 - Every field *except* the minimum version field of the volume header are in
   big endian.
 - Some volume header fields (creation time of volume and header) are missing
   in the documentation.

It is designed for DragonFly BSD, but would work, with minor changes, on any
OS with device mapper and dm-crypt. This is also the reason for the dependency
on libprop, since the DragonFly libdevmapper uses libprop.

Additionally it depends on the current OpenSSL CVS version for the XTS
support. The next major release of OpenSSL will probably include the needed
support, too.

This implementation supports mapping (opening) both system and normal TrueCrypt
volumes, as well as opening hidden volumes and opening an outer volume while
protecting a hidden volume.

Support for creating volume was only recently added and has not been tested yet.
It is highly experimental.

Cascaded encryption algorithms are not supported (yet).
